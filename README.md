# animator
Convert a bunch of static PNGs into an awesome animated GIF.

## Dependencies
Before using **animator**, you need to check if you have installed these dependencies:

- [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)
- [Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/)

## How it works
- Create a `src` folder and put all your PNG files inside. They need to be named following the animation logic (01.png, 02.png...).
- Run the next command in your terminal: `.\animator.sh`
- After some seconds, you will have all your source PNGs into an animated GIF: `animation.gif`.
- Enjoy your animation, get some popcorns.
